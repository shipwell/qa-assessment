/*
    The objective of this exercise is to develop and execute an API functional test for a targeted APi endpoiint.
    Given the short amount of time, the goal is to target a section of the API endpoint response for your functional
    test case verification, that is, do not attempt to write one or more functional tests that cover verification of
    the entire response body. Focus on one area of the response body and write your test verification for that area.

    You may use any test automation framework such as Postman, SuperTest, etc, including WebdriverIO. You may enter your 
    API functonal test code in this file, or directly in the chosen framework, e.g., Postman. Regardless of the chosen
    test framework, you must be able to show your code and perform a test execution demonstration.

    The API endpoint to target for your functional test case is:
        GET https://api.github.com/repos/shipwell/qa-assessment

    If it's helpful, the documentation for this API endpoint can be found at: 
        https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-repository
